<h1>Hi, I'm Zu :) (She/Her)</h1> 

<h3>🚀 About Me</h3>

I'm a third-year Computer Science student, set to graduate in July 2025. I'm currently working on my major project: a visualization tool for volleyball match statistics. My passion lies in full-stack web development, and I'm actively seeking an internship to gain real-world experience, test the waters, and refine my skills to become the best fit for my future company.

<h3>💡 What Drives Me</h3>

- Creativity & UX Design 🎨 - I love designing intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interfaces.

- Optimization & Efficiency ⚡ - Finding the most optimal way to do things excites me.

- Structured Productivity 📝 - I use Notion to organize my university work and personal life.

<h3>💼 Work Experience</h3>

I took a gap year after my second year to gain industry experience and worked as a Software Developer at Zaltek Digital. There, I led user testing for an NHS product, honing my organisation and interview skills.

<h3>🏐 Beyond Coding</h3>

Outside of tech, I'm passionate about volleyball! I play for my university's BUCS team, and I hope to join a club after graduation.

<h3>📫 Let's Connect</h3>

I'm open to opportunities in full-stack web development internships. If you're looking for a motivated, design-focused developer, feel free to reach out!
