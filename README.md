I've chosen to delay the completion of my Computer Science Degree at Aberystwyth University to gain work experience and upskill in relevant areas of the field.
I'm currently taking the HarvardX CS50-AI course and I've been gaining deeper understanding of different search algorithms and the differences between them. 
The quality of the lectures has been really engaging and motivating for me.
I'm also learning React and Typescript atm so I can get started with the majority of the projects I want develop. 
I'm planning to learn dart and flutter to make some apps in the future.

Showing up for myself has always been a challenge for me but I've been actively improving on that by aiming to do something productive each day.
My updated habit tracking notion template has been really helping me with that since I can hold myself accountable and see my daily progress on a neat graph.
My template is available for you to use for free :))

I've recently been consuming more and more content to do with software development so I can find my niche.  
I'm currently mostly interested in the programming language Golang because it has func in the syntax.  
My favourite tech content creators are Primeagen, Fireship and CodeAesthetic.

I also have been grinding out codewars because I'm too scared to start my first project.

My ***current modules*** are : Artificial Intelligence, Software Enginnering and Scientific Python.   
I'm the Project Lead for the group project for the software engineering module and I've been really enjoying learning about Prolog in my AI module.
